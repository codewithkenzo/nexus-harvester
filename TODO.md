- ✅ MCP tools infrastructure setup (merged 2025-05-02)
- ✅ Implemented comprehensive structured logging system (2025-05-02)
- ✅ Applied structured logging to IndexingService (2025-05-02)

## High Priority Tasks
- [ ] Complete error handling in API endpoints (deadline: 2025-05-04)
- [ ] Implement validation for document processing parameters (deadline: 2025-05-04)
- [x] Add comprehensive logging throughout the application (completed: 2025-05-02)
- [ ] Add rate limiting for API endpoints (deadline: 2025-05-05)

## Medium Priority Tasks
- [ ] Enhance chunking algorithm with content-aware features (deadline: 2025-05-10)
- [ ] Improve metadata extraction from ingested documents (deadline: 2025-05-08)
- [ ] Add support for authentication in MCP tools (deadline: 2025-05-06)
- [ ] Create integration tests for the full pipeline (deadline: 2025-05-07)

## Low Priority Tasks
- [ ] Optimize document processing for large files (deadline: 2025-05-15)
- [ ] Add support for additional document formats (deadline: 2025-05-20)
- [ ] Implement monitoring and analytics dashboard (deadline: 2025-05-25)

## Technical Debt / Refactoring
- [ ] Refactor client code for better error handling (deadline: 2025-05-12)
- [ ] Improve code documentation and type hints (deadline: 2025-05-10)
- [ ] Set up E2E testing environment (deadline: 2025-05-15)

## Next Steps (Immediate Action Items)
1. ✅ Implement comprehensive logging in the indexing pipeline (completed)
2. Apply structured logging to remaining components (API endpoints, clients, etc.)
3. Complete the remaining error handling in API endpoints
4. Add validation for document processing parameters
5. Thoroughly test the document ingestion API endpoint
